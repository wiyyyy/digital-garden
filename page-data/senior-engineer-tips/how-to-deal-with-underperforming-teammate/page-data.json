This is Jerry's first dev job, but he's been at the company for about 2.5 years and on my team for 1.5. After a year and a half, he still asks me and other devs on our team (most of whom have less experience than him) very basic questions about how our only product works. He is mostly given unimportant tasks that he takes weeks/months to finish while asking tons of questions and scheduling one-on-one meetings with other devs on the team. At the end of this process, he shows up with something that's borderline unusable and fights tooth and nail to avoid making any changes during code review. He's completed two projects since joining, one of which had to be completely rewritten by a more junior dev while he was pulled away for budgeting reasons to help another team implement something using open source tool X. The other is a testing suite that is mostly ignored and has multiple failing tests in our master branch because it's painful to deal with.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"My solution to this is to try and avoid Jerry as much as possible, so I'm not the person he's scheduling meetings with or downstream from his work. Recently though, after pushing for quite a while, I got the green light from my manager to start working on a solution for our team that involves X. I was told it wasn't a high priority for the business, so I wouldn't be receiving any help from the rest of the team. But, after Jerry directly asked me, my manager, and my scrum master multiple times to help with the project, my manager agreed. I wrote him a straightforward and relatively small story to take an existing feature from our product and implement it using X. As I expected, it's now almost 4 weeks later and despite all of the one on one meetings and DMs we've exchanged he's not finished and the solution in his working branch is way off the mark.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"At this point, I'm beyond frustrated and I'm finding it hard to stay professional when communicating with him.
