## Question
Looking back over your careers, what was it about the best senior or lead software developers you worked with that made them stand out above their peers?

Communication skills, mentoring, breadth of skill set, willingness to learn/admit fault, anything. I'm more interested in skills or habits that can be acquired or otherwise learned, rather than those that you're born with (charm, winning looks, great teeth). You get the picture.

I've managed to be promoted to Senior Software Developer, and I want to make sure that I do the best job that I can. I don't want to get caught up in the Comparison Game, but I am looking for sage advice on effective habits and techniques for being an excellent Senior for my team, with an eventual eye (way, way, way down the road) to earning a Lead position. (Might as well start working on developing those habits now, right?)

To that end, I'm looking to benefit from your experience. Please share whatever wisdom you can spare.
