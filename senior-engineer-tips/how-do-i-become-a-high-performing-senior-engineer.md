## How do I become a high performing Senior/Staff Engineer

I worked with multiple really great senior developers and they all had completely different skillsets which made them "great".

 - One had complete technical knowledge about any framework/tricks in our language.
 - One was a born genius and would understand super complex relationships of our services without a problem
 - Multiple other devs had the drive to be good. They are really result driven and have no ego, so if you find a better solution to their problem, they will use it.
 - One had really great softskills and i respected him alot, because he also respected my (sometimes crazy) ideas and didnt shut them down with an eyeroll or anything, even when i was a junior.

**But one thing all of them had in common was that they really did work and were dedicated to the craft. They really give their best all the time and whenever they finished a task, they didnt just sit there, relax and wait for the end of the sprint to get more tasks, but they took on work automatically. They would also create tickets by themselves to make the product better.**

Also they all where reliable. If you give them work, they will do it. You know that it is in good hands. Not even from a bugfree point of view, but also from a management perspective. They will talk with the right people, they will comunicate cross team to make the feature reality.

But one thing: The properties i mentioned above are not really things which make you more "hireable" for amazon, because they cannot test for this in the interview.

Just try to be better every day and then confidence will come automatically.
